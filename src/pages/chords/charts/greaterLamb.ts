[Verse]
Am                         E7
  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
G                      D
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
F                          C
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Dm
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
E7
  I had to stop for the night
